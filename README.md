## Overview

Chest diseases are a global health concern, requiring accurate and timely diagnosis. This repository provides a deep learning solution to assist in detecting various chest diseases using chest X-ray images. The system leverages Python-based deep learning frameworks to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- **Automated Disease Detection**: Uses chest X-rays to detect potential diseases.
- **Deep Learning**: Implements state-of-the-art neural network models.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for accuracy and efficiency.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karimenBR/PFA.git
   cd PFA
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of chest X-rays (see [Dataset](#dataset)).
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model --data_path /path/to/dataset
   ```

4. Use the model for predictions on new X-ray images:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path /path/to/image --model_path /path/to/model
   ```

## Dataset

This project requires a dataset of labeled chest X-rays for training and evaluation. Public datasets such as [NIH Chest X-ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) or [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) can be used.

Ensure the dataset is pre-processed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model Architecture

The system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizing transfer learning from pre-trained models like ResNet, DenseNet, or VGG. These models are fine-tuned for disease detection tasks.

## Results

The system achieves the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 93%
- **Precision**: 0.93
- **Recall**: 0.98
- **F1 Score**: 0.80
